Hi, my name is Jordan. I'm a backend software developer with experience building greenfield projects and maintaining legacy monoliths in Scala, Kotlin, and Typescript. In my free time I like to ride bikes, draw and paint, and compose music on piano and guitar. I live in Portland, Oregon with my partner Raina and our cat Hoshino. You can find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jcrvne/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordancrane/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/jordancrane).
