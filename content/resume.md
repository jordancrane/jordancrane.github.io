Check out my [resume](./resume.html). It is also available for download in a variety of formats: [pdf](./resume.pdf), [docx](./resume.docx), [rtf](./resume.rtf).

I generated all of these documents from a single source document written in Markdown using [The Markdown Resume](https://github.com/jordancrane/pandoc_resume), an approach which I would highly recommend if you are looking for an easy way to maintain an updated resume in version control.
