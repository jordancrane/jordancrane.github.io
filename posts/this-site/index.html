        <p>I started this site with the original purpose of hosting my resume for easy sharing without much else in mind. That&rsquo;s still mostly all it does, but I&rsquo;ve solved a few problems along the way to make deployments (slightly) cleaner, so I thought I would document my process here.</p>
<p>I keep my resume in version control in a markdown file, and then use the fabulous <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> to convert it to a variety of formats, namely an HTML file for hosting and a PDF file for sharing over email. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jordancrane/pandoc_resume">here</a>, which is forked from <a href="https://github.com/mszep/pandoc_resume">The Markdown Resume</a>, which is based on <a href="https://blog.chmd.fr/editing-a-cv-in-markdown-with-pandoc.html">this</a> blog post. So suffice it to say this is not my idea, but I love the approach and have tweaked it along the way to meet my needs. In order to get the generated files from my resume repository into my GitHub Pages <a href="https://github.com/jordancrane/site">site repository</a>, I was originally using a submodule and simply generating the resume files as part of the deployment process. This had a few drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every time I changed my resume I had to redeploy the whole site.</li>
<li>I use <code>docker-compose</code> to build the resume, and Docker was attempting to use the same container to build it in the resume repository and in the site submodule. This meant I had to run <code>docker container rm</code> every time I switched between updating the resume and deploying the site.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to mitigate these issues I decided to host the resume independently as its own GitHub pages project site, and simply link to it from this site. I could have just used the built-in GitHub Pages setup of the project site being a path under my user site, but I liked the idea of making it a subdomain more (<code>resume.jordancrane.me</code> just looks more appealing than <code>jordancrane.me/pandoc_resume/</code> to me, and I&rsquo;m a sucker for details that literally no one else will notice). To deploy the generated files from my resume repository I opted to <a href="https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490">use a subtree</a> due to the simplicity. This isn&rsquo;t <em>ideal</em> so I may revisit it in the future, but it works for now. Assuming that you already have your personal site configured with a custom domain (GitHub&rsquo;s <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">documentation</a> on this is pretty good) adding a subdomain is pretty straightforward. All you need to do is configure a <code>CNAME</code> file in the root of your deployment branch with your desired subdomain, mine looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">resume.jordancrane.me
</code></pre></div><p>Then you simply configure that as your project&rsquo;s custom domain under the repository settings, and add a new CNAME record to your DNS provider that directs the subdomain host (<code>resume</code>) to your GitHub Pages domain (<code>jordancrane.github.io.</code>). This is pretty simple, and GitHub also documents this well, but I was initially confused by the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t need to point directly to the project site.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve configured this, I can deploy my resume individually directly from it&rsquo;s repository, without deploying the entire site. Additionally I was able to remove the <code>docker-compose</code> step from the build process for the site, so I no longer have to deal with container conflicts from building it in multiple places. I&rsquo;m sure there are better ways still to do this, but I&rsquo;d be lying if I said the small quality of life improvements brought by this change don&rsquo;t bring me some joy. My next step is to move my deployment processes into GitHub Actions so I can get rid of my bad deploy scripts, but I&rsquo;ll save that for another day.</p>
